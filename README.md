# GoHunting

A personal project. I want to understand what skills and requirements are most needed by the jobs I am interested in, and what's the gap between my current state and the job requirements -- which spawned this project. 

Toolkit:
Web scraping;
Python;
Spark;
Scala;
EMR; 

Structure:



Deployment:

I deploy the code on EMR to mimic a production env, however this is costing too much for personal use;
This will be deployed with Docker + Airflow on my machine.
